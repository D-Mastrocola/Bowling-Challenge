# Bowling-Challenge
A bowling simulator made with C#
## About
So I really enjoy bowling, but the bowling video games are garbage and I'm too much of a nerd to actually go out and roll balls down the lane so I am going to ask you to create me a basic bowling simulator...or as much as can be done using random numbers. I am going to list a series of minimum requirements, and a few optional bonus requirements (which are truly optional - no trick question stuff here - do what you are comfortable with doing). Using Visual Studio (Code or full VS), C# in any environment that you are comfortable with (winforms, webforms, blazer, or even console if you want to) complete the minimum requirements and send us back the code. Be prepared to explain your thought process in design and structure.

Minimum Requirements:

-A game will consist of 10 "frames" of play

-The user (me) will click a button/something which will result in me getting a score (no animations or anything needed - nor any complicated probability logic)

-Each frame, the maximum number of pins I can knock down is 10 between two balls I will throw. If I get a 10 on the first ball, I don't need to roll a second ball for the frame.

-On the 10th and final frame, if between the two balls I throw I get 10 pins, I get a bonus ball for extra points.

-Each time a frame is completed, update on the screen my total score so I can see how I am doing.

-Treat scoring like traditional bowling using spares and strikes (Google it if you would like - hard to explain quickly here)

-When the game is complete, give me the option to start a new game which will reset the score and allow me to play again.

Optional Requirements:

-Treat the 10th and final frame like traditional bowling - where if you get a strike on the first ball you get 2 more balls to roll. If you get a strike on the second ball you get a third ball to roll.

-Create something in the UI to let me see my score for each frame, and maybe if I want to change the score for a frame give me that option.

-Save my high score (in any way you would like) and have it displayed for me on the screen so I know what I am trying to beat!

-Give me a cheater button, so no matter what I roll it will always be a strike (so I can test logic for a 300 score)

-Give me a loser button, so no matter what I roll it will always be a 0 (so I can test logic for someone who clearly needs to play bumper bowling)

-Anything else your creative mind can come up with!
